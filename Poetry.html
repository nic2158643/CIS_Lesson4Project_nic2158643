    <h2>Our Imperfect Dog</h2>
    
    <p2>by Cynthia C. Naspinksi</p2> 
    
    <p3>We love our dog with all our hearts,
        But not so much her stinky farts.
        Her doggy breath is less than fresh,
        Yet we hug her nonetheless.</p3>
        
    <p4>She wages war with the lawn mower,
        Outdoor sweeper and leaf blower.
        And switching on the vacuum cleaner
        Won't bring out her best demeanor.</p4>

        <p5>This causes some embarrassment,
            This doggy form of harassment,
            But she does provide protection,
            And for that we feel affection.</p5>

        <p6>Once introductions make the rounds,
            Her friendliness, it knows no bounds.
            Though not all guests are fully rapt
            With thirty kilos on their lap</p6>
